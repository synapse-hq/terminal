Terminal is a web-based tool for testing and debugging webhooks. It provides an easy and convenient way for developers to test the behavior of their applications when receiving webhook requests. With Terminal, users can quickly set up a virtual endpoint to receive incoming webhooks, and inspect the details of each request, such as the headers and payload, in real-time.
